  ## Description
  This logo generator is designed to create a basic svg file using shape and color inputs.  There are three shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, or square.  Color for the logo and the text color are taken in via HTML color codes. This generator will take in three characters for the user's logos.

  ## Installation
  Clone or download this respository. Once it is on a local device the program is run via typeing `node index.js` in a git bash command line or VS Code terminal.

  ## Useage
  This project is designed to create simple svg logos. When run the user is prompted by 4 questions asking what they would like the shape, color, text within the logo, and text color to be. Once all prompts are answered the svg file is generated within the "example" folder under the name logo.svg. Users may keep their file there, but it will be overwritten once they use the generator again so it is reccomended to save your logo elsewhere or rename the file if you wish to keep it.
